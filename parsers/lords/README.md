Lords Parser
=============

This parser fetches the Members of Parliament list from MySociety's [TheyWorkForYou API](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/docs/). 

Parsing
-------

parse_lords.py outputs documents to the `lords_parse` collection, of the following form:

```json
TODO
```

The mongo command: `db.lords_parse.findOne()` is helpful for seeing a real example of this.
