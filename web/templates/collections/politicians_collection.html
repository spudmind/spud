                            <p>Under current Parliamentary rules, our lawmakers are allowed to hold second jobs as long as they are declared. There are rules, however, that prevent them from accepting cash in return for favour. Numerous scandals have revealed the weakness of these rules.</p>
                            <p>It is argued that Parliament is richer for the experience these outside jobs bring. The fact that much of the time, this experience is limited to being a director of a private healthcare company, or an advisor to a financial services firm – rather than, say, bringing the experience of being a teacher, or a scientist – weakens the case fought by Parliamentarians. </p>
