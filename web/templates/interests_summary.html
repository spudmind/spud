            <p><em>"The influence of lobbyists increases when it goes largely unnoticed by the public." </em></p>
            <p>Lobbyists succeed by owning the terms of debate, steering conversations away from those they can't win and on to those they can. If a public discussion on a company's environmental impact is unwelcome, lobbyists will push instead to have a debate with politicians and the media on the hypothetical economic benefits of their ambitions. Once this narrowly framed conversation becomes dominant, dissenting voices will appear marginal and irrelevant.</p>

                    <p>Access and influence are enhanced by having someone on your payroll with power. This could be a former minister, a current legislator, or a political staffer. The power of lobbyists increases the more decision-makers they know. Take the finance industry: the UK comes second only to Switzerland for the number of people moving between the finance sector and government. The access and insider knowledge they have as a consequence is unrivalled.</p>
                    <p>Find out who else our legislators – MPs and Lords – are employed by, as well as by us.</p>
