        <p><em>"The influence of lobbyists increases when it goes largely unnoticed by the public." </em></p>
        <p>Lobbyists succeed by owning the terms of debate, steering conversations away from those they can't win and on to those they can. If a public discussion on a company's environmental impact is unwelcome, lobbyists will push instead to have a debate with politicians and the media on the hypothetical economic benefits of their ambitions. Once this narrowly framed conversation becomes dominant, dissenting voices will appear marginal and irrelevant.</p>

                <p><b>“All the main political parties have been prepared to grant access and influence to those with the wherewithal to fund their operations.”</b><br>
                - Robert Peston, BBC business correspondent
                </p>

                <p>The main aim of much of the money that is channeled into British politics is to influence decisions taken by government. The funding of political parties is no exception. Political parties’ expenditures are thought to have risen threefold since the 1970s, while membership of the parties has plummeted. Stepping into the gap are a limited number of very wealthy donors from business and finance, regardless of the colour of the party. </p>
                <p>Find out who is funding politics in the UK; how they disguise their funding through, for example, dining clubs; and provide in-kind funding to politicians. </p>
