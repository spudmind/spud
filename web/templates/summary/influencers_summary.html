                    <h2>Tobacco firms lay it on for MPs</h2>

                    <p><em>21 May 2015, by Spinwatch</em></p>

                    <a><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='tobacco.jpg') }}" ALT="tobacco" width="40%" align=right></a>

                    <p>Tobacco companies are still waging their 60 year campaign against efforts to protect public health.</p>

                    <p>The latest fight has been against plain packaging, which is seen as an effective means of discouraging the next generation of smokers from becoming addicted. All branding is replaced by drab, olive green packets with larger, more graphic health warnings. The cigarette giants have been determined to stop the UK from introducing it.</p>

                    <p>The data here reveals one flank of their fight to oppose plain packaging: the campaign to persuade Members of Parliament to oppose it. We can see, for example, that <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Japan%20Tobacco%20International">Japan Tobacco International</a> (JTI), makers of Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges, has been on a charm offensive since 2011. It has provided hospitality and tickets to a host of (mainly Conservative) MPs, including £1000 trips to the Chelsea Flower Show, Glyndebourne Opera Festival and Test Match Cricket. <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Imperial%20Tobacco">Imperial Tobacco</a> has also been currying favour, according to the MPs register of interests, supplying MPs with tickets to Wimbledon at £1600 a time.</p>

                    <p>This gives us a glimpse of the recent lobbying by the tobacco industry. It is, however, only a tiny part of a much wider campaign, which has been revealed only through other sources. For example, leaked documents from <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Philip%20Morris">Philip Morris International</a> (PMI), the makers of Marlboro, reveal in detail the extent of the sophisticated lobbying and media campaign that the industry has undertaken to try and dissuade the government from introducing plain packaging.</p>

                    <p>PMI’s leaked media strategy, for example, targeted “key decision makers”, including MPs, civil servants and the UK’s business elite. An internal PMI spreadsheet details how more than 100 MPs were singled out.  An “influencers map” drawn up by PMI identified which politicians, think tanks, business groups and government departments were in favour and which were against. The tobacco firms’ central message to steer politicians into opposing plain packaging was that it would lead to an explosion of illicit cigarettes on the streets of Britain, even though there is overwhelming evidence of the industry’s complicity in smuggling its own products.</p>

                    <p>This data, therefore, is only a starting point to ask more questions. What else are these tobacco companies doing (it is unlikely they are investing in relationships with MPs in isolation): are they directly <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/funding">financing political parties</a>; do they employ <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/lobbying">lobbying agencies</a>; have they any <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/politicians">legislators on their payroll</a>; are they <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/meetings">meeting with ministers</a>?</p>

                    <p>Dip into the data and find out.</p>

                    <h3>Edelman</h3>

                    <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('{{ url_for('static', filename='edelman.jpg') }}');"><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='edelman.jpg') }}" ALT="priti_patel.jpg" width="25%" align=left hspace="10"></a>

                    <p>International agency, <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/lobbyists/Edelman%20Public%20Affairs">Edelman</a>, sees itself as an unconventional player in the corporate PR and lobbying world. Its New York office contains a chunk of the Berlin Wall; London visitors wait in reception to the sound of The Smiths.</p>

                    <p>Yet most of its annual revenues – over $734 million worldwide in 2014, £51m of which comes from the UK – come from a overwhelmingly corporate and definitely un-hip client base.</p>

                    <p>In the UK, the data reveals, Edelman has long lobbied for: alcohol giant, <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Diageo%20plc">Diageo</a>, which for years has fought measures to protect public health; most of the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms; and for oil giant, <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Royal%20Dutch%20Shell%20Group">Shell</a>.</p>

                    <p>Edelman is a pioneer of lobbying techniques. It has a long history of working on astroturf campaigns, for example. This is where seemingly independent groups are created to defend corporate interests. Groups like the astroturf effort for The American Petroleum Institute and oil companies called Energy Citizens, which were supposedly regular folk opposed to oil industry regulation.</p>

                    <p>Edelman has also been a leader in techniques to deal with groups opposing their clients. Key to this is the tactic of ‘divide and rule’, which involves isolating those campaigners with more ‘radical’ views, and engaging with those that might be swayed into agreeing with the corporation’s view. Edelman explains the rationale: ‘You’ve got an environmental disaster on your hands. Have you consulted `with <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a>? Co-opting your would-be attackers may seem counterintuitive, but it makes sense when you consider that NGOs (non-governmental organisations) are trusted by the public nearly two-to-one to ‘do what’s right’.”</p>

                    <p>The data shows that Edelman’s lobbying skills, built working for US oil and gas giants, are currently being employed by the Shale gas industry in the UK. It acts as the secretariat of the supposedly independent <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/influencer/detail/Task%20Force%20on%20Shale%20Gas">Task Force on Shale Gas</a>. Edelman is also suitably well-connected to the government when it comes to lobbying for shale – or fracking – interests. It employs Katie Waring, who used to be an advisor to former energy minister <a href="http://www.undertheinfluence.org.uk/mp/Edward%20Davey">Ed Davey</a>, who steered the Coalition government’s ‘all out for shale’ policy.</p>
