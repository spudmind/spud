            <p>Lobbyists succeed by owning the terms of debate, steering conversations away from those they can't win and on to those they can. If a public discussion on a company's environmental impact is unwelcome, lobbyists will push instead to have a debate with politicians and the media on the hypothetical economic benefits of their ambitions. Once this narrowly framed conversation becomes dominant, dissenting voices will appear marginal and irrelevant.</p>

                        - Steve John, lobbyist for management consultants, McKinsey

                    <p>Commercial lobbyists are paid to influence the decisions of government. The UK has the third-biggest lobbying industry in the world after Washington and Brussels. A best guess values the business in the UK at around £2bn.</p>
                    <p>Lobbying is central to our idea of democratic government, but it can also be a corrupting force that undermines democracy. Lobbying, as practised by those with any influence in the country, costs money. And those with the deepest pockets – mainly multi-national corporations – are buying themselves a louder voice in government than the rest of us. </p>
                    <p>It is almost impossible to find out who is lobbying whom about what in Britain (unlike in the US and Canada). What information there is on the activities of commercial lobbyists, however, is presented here.</p>
                    <p>Find out who has hired lobbyists to influence the British government; who has hired the most; and who are the best connected lobbyists in the business. </p>
